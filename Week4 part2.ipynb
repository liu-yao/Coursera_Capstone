For example, I will use the Search endpoint to make calls to the Foursquare API to search for libraries in Singapore, and learn more about particular libraries. And then, I will continue use the Explore endpoint to retrieve data from the Foursquare database, and use the API to explore a location and to get trending venues around all libraries in Singapore.\n",
